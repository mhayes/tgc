Laravel Foundation
============================================

Laravel PHP Framework with Zurb Foundation framework and Composer bundle to start developing quickly.

### For those who like to try out frameworks other than Twitter Bootstrap for front-end development.

### Note: This version uses Sass/SCSS

You need to install Ruby, RubyGems and Compass. Exact installation instructions can be found on Zurbs website here: [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/gem-install.php](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/gem-install.php)

For this application to work you do not need to follow the instructions on the Foundation website, you only need to have Compass installed and while in terminal in the root of your project write `compass watch .`

See [Laravel](http://laravel.com/ "Laravel Website") website for documentation.
